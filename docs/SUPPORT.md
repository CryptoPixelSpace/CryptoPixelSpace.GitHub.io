## Where to get help

If you think you've found a bug in the Hacker theme, please [check the existing issues](https://github.com/CryptoPixelSpace/cryptopixelspace.github.io/issues), and if no one has reported the problem, [open a new issue](https://github.com/CryptoPixelSpace/cryptopixelspace.github.io/issues/new).

If you have a general question about the theme, how to implement it, or how to customize it for your site you have two options:

1. Search for your query on [`support.github.com`](https://support.github.com/?q=pages+Hacker+theme), which will also look for similar topics on [`github.community`](https://github.community/search?q=CryptoPixelSpace)
2. Ask your question of the CryptoPixelSpace community on [twitter](https://twitter.com/CryptoPixelSP/)
3. [Contact GitHub Support](https://github.com/contact?form%5Bsubject%5D=GitHub%20Pages%20theme%20pages-themes/hacker)
